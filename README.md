Project Title: RecipeMaster: Intelligent Recipe Finder and Meal Planner

What and Why?
RecipeMaster is a web application designed to help users discover recipes based on the ingredients they currently have at home. It also includes a meal planning feature to assist users in organizing their weekly meals and generating corresponding shopping lists. This system addresses the common problem of meal planning and grocery shopping efficiency, particularly for busy individuals or families who may struggle with meal preparation and planning. By leveraging a recipe API, RecipeMaster simplifies the process of finding new and interesting recipes while minimizing food waste by suggesting recipes based on available ingredients.

For Whom?
RecipeMaster is designed for home cooks, busy professionals, and families looking to streamline their meal planning process. It targets individuals who want to make the most of their pantry items and reduce the stress associated with meal preparation. The target users are real people who need practical solutions for efficient cooking and grocery shopping, such as young professionals, busy parents, and anyone interested in optimizing their cooking routines.

How?
From an end-user's perspective, RecipeMaster will offer the following features:
1. **Ingredient-Based Recipe Search:** Users can input the ingredients they have on hand to find recipes that utilize those items.
2. **Meal Planner:** Users can organize their weekly meal plans by selecting recipes and scheduling them for specific days.
3. **Shopping List Generator:** Based on the selected recipes and meal plans, the application will generate a shopping list that users can take to the grocery store.
4. **Recipe Database Integration:** The application will pull recipe data from an external recipe API to provide a diverse range of recipes and ensure up-to-date information.
5. **User Accounts:** Users can create accounts to save their favorite recipes, meal plans, and shopping lists for future reference.

Scope
The scope of RecipeMaster is well-suited for a team of 4-6 students within a semester. The project involves developing a web application with a focus on front-end and back-end integration, which is manageable within this timeframe. The use of existing APIs for recipe data reduces the complexity of the back-end development, allowing the team to focus on user interface design and functionality. Additionally, the project provides opportunities to tackle challenges related to user experience, data handling, and integration, making it a balanced and achievable project for the semester.
